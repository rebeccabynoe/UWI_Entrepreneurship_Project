# UWI_Entrepreneurship_Project
UWI Cavehill 1st Year entrepreneurship project 
I started working on this project for my entrepreneurship class in the first year in 2023. We were tasked with developing a business idea that addresses a real problem, and Raindrop Reserve was created since human beings need clean drinking water on demand whenever there is a blackout. I got to learn how to develop business plans, problem analysis, and product development while using my creativity to solve a real problem along the way.
About Raindrop Reserve:
Raindrop Reserve is an innovative solution designed to provide a sustainable and reliable source of drinking water during water outages. Our system collects rainwater from rooftops, purifies it, and stores it for use when municipal water supply is unavailable.

 How It Works:
- Collects rainwater from rooftops
- Filters and purifies the water
- Stores it for emergencies and everyday use

With climate change and increasing water shortages, Raindrop Reserve ensures that households and businesses always have access to clean drinking water.
